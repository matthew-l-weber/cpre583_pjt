      Number using O6 output only:             649
      Number using O5 and O6:                    3
    Number used as Memory:                      64 out of  17,920    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:            64
        Number using O6 output only:            64
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                         2

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   245 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          884
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           223 out of     884   25%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 167 out of     884   18%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         494 out of     884   55%
    Number of unique control sets:               8
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               7 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        69 out of     640   10%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.97
